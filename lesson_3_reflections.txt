When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
	When I work on multiple computers or collaborate with other people

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
	So that I can have control over what gets merged when

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
	Fork is when I clone someone else's repository for me on GitHub. Clone is a a copy of a repository. Branches are different evolutions of a repository. I fork when I want to make available to other people the changes I've made to someone else's repository (since I can't push to their repository). I clone when I just want to work on someone else's code or copy my own repository from GitHub to local. Branches are for evolution of code in a rep without changing master.
